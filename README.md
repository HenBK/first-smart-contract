# first-smart-contract
First smart contract that I have ever made (after making a lot of simpler smart contracts hahah).

I'm learning solidity for the first time, and this year (lets go 2022 ðŸŽ‰) is the first time I have deployed a half decent contract to a testnet, [Here's the deployment link](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0x9b908946a435c84e3220aa73035dfff65b0a2678dcf6c9331c738c00500b1ffa "My first smart contract deployment") if you're interested on checking that out, I can't wait to deploy on the mainnet, I just need a little more time, patience and knowledge, and some cash as well because gas fees are a thing right? xDD.

I'm just sharing my progress, so I hope I keep learning more, I'm using [This course](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-ethereum-and-solidity-programming-with-real-world-apps/ "Udemy course I'm using to learn solidity") and it has been incredibly useful, it is pretty much a hands on course, totally recomended if you already have a little programming knowledge.

Just for the record, I have to say to whoever is reading this that I'm aware that there are comments in spanish on the code, totally intentional of course xDD,
the reason is because that way I remeber better some details about what I was doing, I tend to do that when studying, also there is a lot of people that can read spanish and can find the comments helpful right?, so I'm truly sorry english-only friends :(. But hey, lets thank google for this -> https://translate.google.com/?sl=es&tl=en&op=translate xD.

Anyway, thanks for reading me hahah, and happy new year (whenever the heck you're reading this) everyday is day 1, lets always remember that my sisters and brothers.

P.S: If you have any suggestion in regards to the code or even better, if you want to teach me some more advanced solidity (or blockchain dev in general) I'm all open to that xD, meanwhile I'll be finishing my course.

Cheers :) !!
